            <h2> Our Mission</h2>
            <div><blockquote>"Imagine if trees gave off Wifi signals. We would be planting so many trees and we'd probably save the planet too. Too bad the only produce the oxygen we breath."</blockquote></div>
                <p>We have a problem. Our Earth is suffering and we aren't doing enough to save it. Our end goal is to motivate you, our fellow human beings, and push towards a better, more Earth friendly future.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Step 1:</p>
                    <p>Choose a Tree - Our gallery has thousands of plantable trees to choose from. Find one that suits your individual personality</p>
                <p>Step 2:</p>
                    <p>Plant a Tree - With a donation of as low as $300 you can plant your first tree.</p>
                <p>Step 3:</p>
                    <p>Watch It Grow - Your tree will take anywhere from 10 to 30 years to grow to its full size.</p>
                <p>Step 4:</p> 
                    <p>Cash In On Your Investment - After your tree has grown to its full height, you can "cash in" on this investment for a large return vaue. (See! Money CAN grow on trees!)</p>
                <p>Step 5:</p> 
                    <p>Enjoy - Take a deep breath of air and take acknowledgement of the fact that you are breathing in oxygen that virtually belongs to you.</p>
                <p>Step 6:</p>
                    <p>Tell A Friend - We want to spread this to as many people as possible, and word of mouth is a beautiful thing.</p>
