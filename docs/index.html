            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <section class = "one" role="complementary"> 
                <p>Step 1:</p>
                    <p>Choose a Tree - Our gallery has thousands of plantable trees to choose from. Find one that suits your individual personality</p></section>
            <section class = "two">
                <p>Step 2:</p>
                    <p>Plant a Tree - With a donation of as low as $300 you can plant your first tree.</p></section>
            <section class = "three" role="complementary">
                <p>Step 3:</p>
                    <p>Watch It Grow - Your tree will take anywhere from 10 to 30 years to grow to its full size.</p></section>
            <section class = "four">
                <p>Step 4:</p> 
                    <p>Cash In On Your Investment - After your tree has grown to its full height, you can "cash in" on this investment for a large return vaue. (See! Money CAN grow on trees!)</p></section>
            <section class = "five" role="complementary">
                <p>Step 5:</p> 
                    <p>Enjoy - Take a deep breath of air and take acknowledgement of the fact that you are breathing in oxygen that virtually belongs to you.</p></section>
            <section class = "six">
                <p>Step 6:</p>
                    <p>Tell A Friend - We want to spread this to as many people as possible, and word of mouth is a beautiful thing.</p></section>
